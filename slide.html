# What is it?

In short: Living in a van
What comes to your mind when you think about people living in the van?

FBI? CARTON? HIPPIE? BREAKING BAD? DRUGS? CREEPY? SUPERFLEX VEGAN/HAMP/YOGA/MEDATATION GURU?

Well, You are all right, absolutely right.

It's just not my van life.

Let me tell you that the way you live is not a dependency to ensure you the
uniqueness, it's just slightly different to most fellows. Not thing biggie.

# What is my motivation?
### A Pragmatic move for a idealist
???
How I first got into this life?
Last year while I studied my CS and Math degree in ANU. I made some crazy
realisation:
1. I'm quite crazy
2. I spend most of my time at uni, in a normal day, I would be out at
10am(11am really), and back around 10pm, for those super motivated
period(projects/competetion/final/assignment), I would staie there without
too much concern of time, so home would become a special occasion for me
3. of course, I was/am/will be for enternity single??
4. I was paying about $200 rent per week
5. So quite rational question surfaced in my gaintitc head ==> What is home?
6. Home is physical place, a location, with an unique address, that will be
called upon when I need rest/cook/bath/practicing guitar/.../, so IT IS a
Symbol, just like a symbol in Ruby... 2 mins ponding time for you all
7. Time flies...
8. If Home is merely a symbol that occupy my memory, what's the possibility of
detach it.
9. TDD: Test Driven Development also works for this,

.red[*] not as simple as replacing home address

# As a Rubist

### .red[:home] is not just a Symbol nor a fixed address in memory or physical, names of where and how we live don't matter, the value behinded .red[:home] matter, make it meaningful.

```ruby
life = { ... home: "where the ❤️ is" ...}
