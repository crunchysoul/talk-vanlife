# What is it?

### In short: Living in a van fulltime
???
In short: Living in a van
What do you think about people living in the van?

FBI? CARTON? HIPPIE? BREAKING BAD? DRUGS? CREEPY? SUPERFLEX VEGAN/HAMP/YOGA/MEDATATION GURU?

Well, You are all right, absolutely right.

It's just not my van life.

---
# What is my motivation?
### A Pragmatic move for an idealist

???
How I first got into this life?
Last year while I studied my CS and Math degree in ANU.
I made some crazy realisation:
- friends who live in van
- spend most of my time at uni, in a normal day, so home would become a special occasion for me
- JOKE: of course, I was/am/will be for enternity single??
- I was paying about $200 rent per week
- rational question surfaced in my gaintitc head ==> What is home?
- Home is physical place, a location, with an unique address, that will be
called upon when I need rest/cook/bath/practicing guitar/.../, so IT IS a
Symbol, just like a symbol in Ruby... 2 mins ponding time for you all
- If Home is merely a symbol that occupy my memory, what's the possibility of
detach it.
- TDD: Test Driven Development also works for this, 

---
# Imagine Van Life is a project
### think any technologies

???

- for this presentation, similarity
- we all programmer, let's analog this to something, programming project
- like ruby on rails, react, sinatra
- as a creator, we want to lure people, what would we do?
---
background-image: url(./assets/img/vanlifes.jpg)

???
- make it nice and easy, all the best
- nice hippies, lots of beautiful women, nice scenery
- super chill and cool
- not bad, seems good

# Awesome Buzzwords .red[*]
### .blue[Amazing Views, Freedom, Adventure, Inexpensive, Outdoorsy, Work anywhere, Minimally Easy, Rainbow, Unicorn...]
<!-- ### .blue[Agile, Flexible, Easy Implementation, Customisable, Low cost, Unique, Rainbow] -->
.red[*] what shows on home page

???
- copied from a online article, 11 benefits of vanlife
- minimally easy
- like every problems has been solved by this life style(like technos)
---
# Hello world .red[*]

.left[
```ruby
def van_life(life)
  life[:home], life[:van_feeling] = "Van", "Freedom and Awesomeness"
  return rainbow_n_unicorn
end
```
]
.red[*] what shows on home page

???
- super easy hello world, right?
- replace home address with just a van,
- add infinity awesomeness to life
- expecting rainbow and unicorn
---
# Getting Started

???
- All good and dandy
- curiosity, programmer, and cat, so let do it
- Let's buy van and get cool
- well, in reality, not really, just like programming, hello world seems so different to real implementation of project
- let's step back
- Do I really suit to this life?
- Not really, here is the proper step, one should at least consider to do
- your milage may vary
---
# System requirement check .red[*]

.left[
```ruby
def system_check?(person)
  has_children?
  has_pet?
  has_house?
  has_car?
  has_hobbies?
  has_initial_investment?
  regular_locations?
  relationship_status
  empolyment_status
  live_witout_(*)?
  sleep_pattern
  ...
end
```
]

.red[*] before_action: think as many as possible

???
- This is by not means rule,
- And I happen to be a single guy, who spend way to much time at things that should, programming
- DO IT by your heart

# Buying a van .red[*]
.left[
```ruby
def buy_van(van)
  case van
  when "stealth van"
    return { pros:
              [ "cheap", "stealth" ],
            cons:

  when "pop top van"
    return { pros:
              [ "relative stealth", "stand", "factory build" ],

  else
    search_a_unicorn

???
Remember the time you know have to nav in vim
- same, but you have no idea what is waiting ahead
- three example:
  - fridge, rooftop
  - raining night broken down

# How to survive van life?
### Planning and Adapting

???
- two things that are really important
---
# Planning

.left[
```ruby
def make_plan
  important_locations = {
    water_supply: [
      "friends' place",
      "old apartment",
      "camping ground",
      "tourist center",
      "university",
      "restaurants",
      "workplaces",
      "gym",
      "anywhere I can get"
    ],
    toilets: [
      "gym",
      "library",
      "24hours restaurant",
      "petrol stations"
    ],
    gas_cylinder: "Bunnings",
    fuel: "petrol station",
    late_night_work: [
      "university library",
      "Pancake Parlours (wifi: lovely57)",
    ],
    park_locations: [...],
    ...
  }
end
```
]

???
supply
- location
- mail
- toilet
- shower
- park

# Planning .red[*]

### .violet[Always plan ahead everyday]
where heading to, important_locations, where to park for the night

.red[*] do what flight/ship Captains do

???
- without plan, hours can be wasted on driver seat
---
# Planning .red[*]

### .violet[Keep monitoring and loging]
vehicle condition, fuel level, electricity level, water level, gas level

.red[*] do what flight/ship Captains do

???
gas cylinder
- fridege
- elec
---
# Adapting .red[*]

### .violet[Stay alert to inside of van]
things and equipment can and will breakdown, and always at the most inconvenient time

.red[*] do what ship mechanics do
---
# Adapting .red[*]

### .violet[Stay alert to outside of van]
environment and surrounding, human interactions, inform others openly

.red[*] do what securities do
---
# Get into van life

.left[
```ruby
def van_life_steps
  system_check
  buy_van
  move(apartment, van)
  maintain_van_life
  make_plan
  be_adaptive
end
```
]
---
# Buzzwords revision .red[*]

### .blue[Agile, Environment friendly, Essence focused, Open to others, Cherish, Adaptable, Great challenge, Experiences, Insight, Courage ]

.red[*] with experiences as project creator, maintainer and user

???
- how to be agile, think fast, and move fast, as home the last safety concept is gone, you are out there all the time
---
# Hello World revision .red[*]
.left[
```ruby
def van_life(life)
  life[:home] = "Van"

  life.update(life) do |key, value|
    live_with_van(value)
  end

  return life
end
```
]

.red[*] not as simple as replacing home address

???
It's not as simple as change, is about add this attribute to everything in life
---
# As a Rubist

### .red[:home] is not just a Symbol nor a fixed address in memory or physical, names of where and how we live don't matter, the value behinded .red[:home] matter, make it meaningful.

```ruby
life = { ... home: "where the ❤️ is" ...}
```
